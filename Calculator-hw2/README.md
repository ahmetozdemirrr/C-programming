# Homework Program

This program consists of several distinct tasks, each implemented as a separate function. The main function acts as a menu, allowing the user to choose a specific task to perform. Each task function then calls another function to perform the calculation related to that task.

## Tasks

1. **Task 1: Sum of Two Numbers**
    - Function: `int addNumbers(int num1, int num2)`
    - Description: Takes two integers as input, adds them, and returns the result.

2. **Task 2: Product of Two Numbers**
    - Function: `int multiplyNumbers(int num1, int num2)`
    - Description: Takes two integers as input, multiplies them, and returns the result.

3. **Task 3: Division of Two Numbers**
    - Function: `float divideNumbers(float num1, float num2)`
    - Description: Takes two floating-point numbers as input, performs division, and returns the result.
