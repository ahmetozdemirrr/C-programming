# CSE102 Assignment #8 - Collatz Conjecture

## Description
This C program explores the Collatz conjecture, a mathematical problem that involves generating a sequence based on a given function. The assignment requires implementing recursive functions, working with pointers, and analyzing the sequence for loops and other patterns.

## Functions Implemented
1. **generate_sequence**
    - Generates and returns the Collatz sequence recursively.
    - Parameters:
        - `int xs`: The first element of the sequence.
        - `int currentlen`: The current length of the sequence.
        - `int seqlen`: The desired length of the sequence.
        - `int *seq`: An array to store the sequence.

2. **check_loop_iterative**
    - Checks if the sequence generated by a given function ends up in a loop.
    - Parameters:
        - `void (*f)(?)`: Function pointer for the sequence generation function.
        - `int xs`: The starting integer for the sequence.
        - `int seqlen`: The length of the sequence.
        - `int *loop`: An array to store the loop.
        - `int *looplen`: The length of the loop.

3. **has_loop**
    - Checks if a given sequence has a loop.
    - Parameters:
        - `int *arr`: The input sequence.
        - `int n`: Length of the sequence.
        - `int looplen`: The expected length of the loop.
        - `int *ls`: Output parameter for loop start index.
        - `int *le`: Output parameter for loop end index.

4. **hist_of_firstdigits**
    - Calculates the histogram of the first digits of the sequence generated by a given function.
    - Parameters:
        - `void (*f)(?)`: Function pointer for the sequence generation function.
        - `int xs`: The starting integer for the sequence.
        - `int seqlen`: The length of the sequence.
        - `int *h`: An array to store the histogram.
        - `int digit`: The digit to ignore (usually 0).

## Program Flow
1. Take the first element and the size of the sequence as inputs from the user.
2. Call `check_loop_iterative` to generate the sequence, print it, and check for a loop.
3. Print the loop information (if any).
4. Call `hist_of_firstdigits` to calculate and print the histogram of first digits.

## General Rules
- Follow the provided function prototypes.
- Develop the program on Ubuntu using the GCC compiler.
- Do not use additional libraries.
- Use malloc/calloc for memory allocation.

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
$ make clean   # Remove compilation results and intermediate files
$ make compile # Compile the code
$ make run     # Run the code with any required parameters
